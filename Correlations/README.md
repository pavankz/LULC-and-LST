The analysis showed that there has been a 227.87% increase in urban built-up area from 1998 to 2022 as result from the temporal analysis to a sharp decrease of 84.61% area in other places

The GHMC has undergone explosive growth in the form of residential, commercial, retail, transit networks, parking lots

Urban green space and waterbodies shows minimum temperature compared to urban built-up areas along the time scale

One of the reasons of having high temperatures values for others (bare land) is that most bare lands are in areas where there is a reduction in vegetation cover

Green spaces in urban areas have a positive effect on urban climate change and microclimate

Both LULC and biophysical indices are equally important in  resolving the variability of urban landscape estimation of LST

Where the urban biophysical indices are positively correlated, on the other hand vegetation biophysical indices are negatively correlated with LST
